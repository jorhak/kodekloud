The Nautilus DevOps team is strategically planning the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Acknowledging the magnitude of this endeavor, they have chosen to tackle the migration incrementally rather than as a single, massive transition. They created some services in different regions and later found that some of those can be deleted now.

Delete a VPC named `datacenter-vpc` present in `us-east-1` region using `Terraform`. Make sure to keep the provisioning code, as we might need to provision this instance again later.

The Terraform working directory is `/home/bob/terraform`.

`Note:` Right-click under the `EXPLORER` section in `VS Code` and select `Open in Integrated Terminal` to launch the terminal.
